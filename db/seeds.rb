r1 = Review.create(comment:"I liked this film very much. It is much darker than the previous outings, but not as faithful to the source material. The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful." , rating: 5 , user_id: , movie_id: m1.id)

r2 = Review.create(comment: "After reading JRR Tolkien's incredible Middle Earth classics nearly half a century ago,  I was sure it would never be possible to do these books justice on the movie screen.  Time passes, however, and technical advances have brought imagination to glorious life.  Add in the incredible makeup and costumes, and most of all the commitment to the time required for a FULL depiction from book to screen, and you have a fantastic experience.  The acting is wonderful,  and true to character.   For lovers of the books, this is a must see.", rating: 5 , user_id: , movie_id: m2.id)

r3 = Review.create(comment: "If it bleeds, we can kill it in this Rambo/Alien movie, a team of Special Forces led by Major Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) are sent in the jungle of Val Verde to rescue hostages held by hostile forces. His team includes Hawkins (played by Lethal Weapon writer Shane Back), Billy (played by 48 Hours the late Sonny Landom), Mac (played by Commando's Bill Duke), Poncho (played by Richard Chaves), Blain (played by Jesse Ventura), and of course Dillon (played by Rocky's Carl Weathers), after taking out the forces, they captured Anna, the sole survivor of the assault and make their way to the extraction point, However they being hunted by something that is not from this world, it can see the heat of our bodies and the heat of our fears. And one by one, it starts taking out each member of the Team. Now its up to Dutch to stop it before it makes a Trophy out of him. I first saw this movie back in Waldo Burton Memorial and it has since becomes one of my favorites. The Predator is play by the late Kevin peter Hall who also star in another Alien movie who hunts for sport in the lesser known film: Without Warning. The Predator has become an icon in recent years though it doesn't meet the same aspects of Alien. Let's hope Arnold returns in a future Predator Movie." , rating: 5,  user_id: , movie_id: m3.id)

This was so well made that it sparks your interest in watching this movie, never a dull moment, there is always thrill and curiosity, never have I heard of this until now and I am disappointed in myself that I haven't seen this after it was released." , rating: 4 ,user_id: , movie_id: m4.id)

r5 = Review.create(comment: "This is the best animated film ever made. Each and every joke lands immaculately, even some of the more immature ones. It's a perfect spoof on cliche buddy roadtrip movies, with most of the jokes being at its and its peers' expense. The plot is wondrously unserious and comedically contrived. All of these years later, it's still an entertaining watch, with hilarious jokes, incredible visuals, and a great accompanying score. It pokes fun at cheesy showtunes, cliche plot conveniences, and even celebrity cameos, all while having a meritable lesson about being yourself. I am not joking when I say that I believe this to be the best animated movie ever made.", rating: 5 , user_id: User.id.sample, movie_id: m5.id)

r6 = Review.create(comment: "I'm not entirely sure what this films about but I managed to get a small grasp on the plot in that Harrison ford is after some androids or robots but then realises he himself, might be a pickle. Whatever it was I enjoyed the colours and cinematography, the acting was actually excellent aswell, especially the scene in the dining room where Harrison Ford discovers a piece of cheese in the shape of a cat, his emotion of shock and pain was supurb. 
The first half of the film is somewhat slow but intense, spending time character building, even though I had absolute no idea what was going on but I LOVED IT!.
Excellent choices of weather was used, mostly rain. The costumes were brilliant and futuristic aswell, but not too over the top, had no idea if was set in the future or not, but it looked like it was. 
Apologies that this review probably doesn't help anyone, as like i said i didn't understand the film too well, but i enjoyed the atmosphere it created for my tiny mind. I will likely watch this again in a few years, but this time i will watch it with subtitles and a plate of coconut biscuits which helps me concentrate better. 
Thankyou all.", rating: 4, user_id: User.id.sample , movie_id: m6.id)

r15 = Review.create(comment: "was very disappointed in Peter Jackson. He professed to be a fan of Tolkien and his books. The Hobbit movies were really a tragedy. Made up characters and story lines.. very very disappointing. Especially following LOTR. The only issue I had there was in Return of the King.. he didn't include a large integral part of the end of the book. But really he did that series right. Which is very high praise considering how few directors can do that, book too screen. Peter Jackson is remarkable. But he should call a do over on the Hobbit. This was actually my fav book of them all, but I couldn't finish the movies because they were so wrong, not even close to Tolkien's masterpiece.", rating: 2 , user_id: User.id.sample , movie_id: m2.id)

If you want a movie with action, sci-fi, suspense, little bit of gore, comedy (let's be honest some of the scenes are hilaroius), muscles, and good old fashion kicking-arse; then this is your film.

Perfect cast, beautiful soundtrack, beautiful cinematography and an interesting plot. No one could do this role perfectly than Ben Whishaw.

r18 = Review.create(comment:"LOVE the movie! Brilliant visuals and a magnificent story line, full of fun, adventures and most importantly SURPRISES! This movie was literally the bomb and most definitely did the T.V show proud. As a SpongeBob luvr/fanatic myself, I have to say this movie is exactly what I dreamed about and filled my life's desires. This movie truly was and IS the highlight of my life and completes my backstory to a T! This movie is completely relatable and HILARIOUS, it had me weeing all over the place; however it had a drop of sadness when they SPOILER nearly hecking died, WHATTTT!!!

r19 = Review.create(comment: "Where the hell's my 1984 Darryl Hannah sex replicant,  or my 1984 Sean Young sex replicant?????!!!!!! Blade Runner's, pacing is like pouring molasses. It sort of spurts toward it's  goal. I was honestly picking out Window air-conditioners on line during the first hour. We all know if Harrison Ford isn't playing, Indiana Jones,  or ,Hans Solo, he's pretty damn dull. And, a very dull-boy , he is here. Production designer, Lawrence G. Pauli, Jordan Cronenweth, Art.Di. David L. Snyder Set.Di. create a marvelous world. Equal to Tara, in GWTW, or, OZ,  For some reason it's always raining in this universe. ( Climate Control  ????) Everything looks slippery,  Ford's, narration is horrendous. Good turn from Rutger Hauer, ( he almost makes this thing watchable. ) Daryl Hannah, & William Sanderson", rating: 1 , user_id: User.id.sample, movie_id: m6.id)

I love it, it's not perfect. My favorite thing about it is that at first when you watch it, it feels like another ordinary 80's action movie, but then it switches gears and turns into a slasher film. And the Predator is my favorite part of the film! I recommend it!" , rating: 4 , user_id: , movie_id: m3.id)

r28 = Review.create(comment: "Of the entire Hobbit trilogy, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is probably the film that expands on the original book the least. This is a fast-paced, epic adventure - once you get past the extended scenes at Bag End. Seriously - they're in Bilbo's house for about half an hour, or at least it seems. 
Otherwise, this film is pretty awesome. The 'overuse' of CGI that critics complain about isn't really a big deal, and Erebor, the home of the dwarves, looks pretty epic. An Unexpected Journey isn't quite as good as the Lord of the Rings films, but as far as fantasy filming goes, this one is (fairly) close to the top." , rating: 4, user_id: User.id.sample , movie_id: m2.id)
